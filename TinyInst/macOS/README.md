## Limitations on macOS

* TinyInst may not always detect the exact time of target process exit. As a consequence the `OnProcessExit()` callback might have a maximum delay of 100ms. In the future, additional APIs (e.g. kqueue) could be used to detect process exit accurately.
* The coverage module that comes with TinyInst is unable to collect coverage at the time of process exit. The workaround for this at the moment is to define a target method and collect coverage at the time the target method exits. In the future, this will be resolved by allocating coverage buffer as shared memory.
* TinyInst on macOS has a `-gmalloc` flag, which enables Gurard Malloc when starting up a target process. However, at this time this flag is incompatible with the `-target_method` flag.
* TinyInst on macOS is affected by the same custom exceptions-handling issues as the Windows version. For the description of the issue and workarounds, see [this section in the readme](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/TinyInst#return-address-patching)
